        <h3>Forming a Group</h3>
        <p>
        Ideally, you will form into <b>groups of 2-3</b> to complete your
        projects.
        It is OK to work with people external to the class (see
        below on external collaborators). Otherwise, if you really want to
        work alone, please discuss your situation with me. Please use
        EdStem to search for group members, or, discuss right after class!

        <h3>External Research and External Collaborators</h3>
        <p>
            You are allowed to use external research projects for the
                class project (this also applies to projects for other
                seminar classes). If you are the only student working on the
                project, that is fine as well. However, the following should
                additionally apply:
                <ul>
					<li>The topic of the research has a clear overlap with the topics and themes of the class.</li>
					<li> You discuss the situation with me beforehand, before the proposal is due.</li>
					<li>You discuss with your other collaborators on the project and they are ok with you using the research as your class project.</li>
                    <li>You clearly state what work has already happened and what new work you will do over the semester.</li>
					<li> If the project involves student collaborators external to the class, you must give sufficient evidence to prove you are leading or co-leading the project (e.g., you would either be first or co-first author if submitted for publication) and you must explicitly lay out which parts of the project you are responsible for.
					</li>
				</ul>
		You are allowed to use the same project as another seminar (2000-level) class, as long as:
				<ul>
					<li>You clear the situation with me and <b>the instructor of the other class</b>.	
					</li>
					<li>
						The topic of the research has clear overlap with the themes of this course.
					</li>
				</ul>

        <h3>Topics</h3>
        <p>
        I have made an <a
            href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/66130/discussion/5257143">EdStem Post</a> that links to a document
        with project ideas; these are not meant to be exact suggestions, but
        rather, starting points for projects you can do. From these, you
        should develop your own hypothesis, plan to measure this hypothesis
        (which might include implementing or modifying a system), and
        final evaluation. As I mention in the doc, if you are specifically
        interested in later extending this project into an independent
        research project, you can meet with me to discuss what ideas might work
        well.

        <h3>Proposal Deliverables (Due 9/29)</h3>
        <p>
        Your proposal should be a 2-page, double column document that states the
        following. References do not need to fit in the page limit. It should be formatted either using the
        <ahref="https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates">Usenix
        style template</a> OR the ACM Proceedings Sigplan template
    (double-column, 10-pt font). Please submit 1 proposal <b>per
        group</b>.
				<ul>
                    <li>Problem: What is the problem you are solving? Why is
                    it important? Is it particularly important today in the
                    face of recent trends?</li>
                    <li>Project idea / hypothesis: What is your solution? How well does your solution solve
                        the problem? Think of this as the hypothesis you
                        are trying to test: what benefits will your system
                        provide and in what scenarios will it provide this
                        benefit (it might not be beneficial in all cases).
                        
                    If this is a reproducibility project in a
                    different language, this is the hypothesis of whether the
                    system can be faithfully implemented in the new language, or
                    if the performance or API has to differ in any way.
                    </li>
                    <li>Novelty: How is this idea new
                        compared to existing work? If this is a reproducibility
                    project, explain why your effort will differ from the
                    original implementation.</li>
                    <li>Description of implementation effort that will be
                        involved, broken down into a timeline.</li>
                    <li>Plan for resources for both development and test: can
                        you develop and evaluate on your local machine, in cloudlab, or
                        in the department cluster?</li>
                    <li>Evaluation Plan: How do you plan to evaluate your
                        idea or system? What key metric will you use? What baseline
                        will you compare against?</li>
                    <li>Team members and breakdown of how work will be divided
                    across team members</li>
                    <li>Any challenges you may encounter</li>
                </ul>
